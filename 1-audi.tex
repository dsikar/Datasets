\subsection{Audi}
The Audi dataset (\cite{geyer2020a2d2}) consist of a total 2.7TB data. Though, since we are interested in image and steering angle only, our data can be narrowed to to 
\begin{verbatim}
    https://aev-autonomous-driving-dataset.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/README-SensorFusion.txt
    
- steering_angle_calculated
- steering_angle_calculated_sign

- 'cam_front_center'
\end{verbatim}

All paths extractable from json files. TODO, verify size of images, ideally resize and end up with manageable size e.g. 10's GB.
